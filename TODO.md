# Planned Features and Fixes for define

## Features
-  ~~Add the ability to customize colors using a config file (probably json)~~
-  ~~Put multiple defintions on the screen (includes parts of speech and definition)~~
   -  Allow screen to scroll up and down to show all definitions returned by wordnik
-  Add the ability to arrow around and select a new word within the definition (or part of speech?) to lookup using define.py

## Fixes
- Turn *all* magic numbers into constants

# WordnikCLI
A program for getting simple definitions for English words on the command line

This program uses BeautifulSoup, the Wordnik API (currently does scraping, but API use will be used in the future), requests (for python) to give
simple definitions for English words on the command line.

Currently a work and in progress more to come (I think)

Here are some examples of what it looks like

`./define.py think`

![Alt Text](/images/think_out.png "terminal window showing fish shell prompt and define.py think")

![Alt Text](images/think_in.png "terminal window showing the result of define.py think")

Another example:

`./define.py onomatopoeia`

![Alt Text](/images/onomatopoeia_out.png "terminal window showing fish shell prompt and define.py onomatopoeia")

![Alt Text](images/onomatopoeia_in.png "terminal window showing the result of define.py onomatopoeia")

Another example again:

`./define.py goal`

![Alt Text](/images/goal_out.png "terminal window showing fish shell prompt and define.py goal")

![Alt Text](images/goal_in.png "terminal window showing the result of define.py goal")
